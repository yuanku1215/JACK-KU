  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am an undergraduate student with a background in spatial information science,
    optimization, and computational modeling. My interests focus on GIS-based
    network analysis, pedestrian routing optimization, and quantum-inspired
    heuristics for large-scale decision problems.

<h2>Selected Projects</h2>

<h3>Undergraduate Research Project</h3>
<p>
  <b>Pedestrian Routing Optimization Using GIS</b><br>
  This undergraduate research project focuses on modeling pedestrian route choice
  using GIS-based network analysis and optimization techniques. Multiple objectives,
  including distance, safety, and accessibility, were considered to support
  decision-making in urban environments.
</p>

<h3>Senior Internship</h3>
<p>
  <b>Applied Optimization and Spatial Analysis</b><br>
  During my senior internship, I applied optimization models and spatial data
  analysis techniques to real-world datasets. The work emphasized translating
  analytical results into practical decision-support insights.
</p>

<h3>Course Project</h3>
<p>
  <b>Supply Chain Optimization</b><br>
  This course project involved formulating and solving supply chain optimization
  problems using mathematical programming. Emphasis was placed on objective
  functions, constraints, and modeling assumptions to evaluate system performance.
