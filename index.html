  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am an undergraduate student with a background in spatial information science,
    optimization, and computational modeling. My interests focus on GIS-based
    network analysis, pedestrian routing optimization, and quantum-inspired
    heuristics for large-scale decision problems.
