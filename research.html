      Pedestrian Routing Optimization Using GIS
    </div>

      <p><b>Role:</b> Undergraduate Researcher</p>
      <p><b>Research Area:</b> Pedestrian routing, spatial network analysis</p>
      <p><b>Methods:</b> Multi-objective optimization, GIS-based modeling</p>
      <p><b>Tools:</b> Python, GIS software, spatial network libraries</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Research Motivation</h2>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>
    Levee systems protect cities from flooding but often act as barriers that hinder
    local mobility. This research proposes an integrated multi-objective optimization
    and spatial analysis framework for selecting levee crossing facilities in
    riverfront districts of New Taipei City, Taiwan.
    </p>

    <p>
    The framework simultaneously considers construction and sidewalk improvement
    costs, population coverage, spatial equity, and traffic safety by incorporating
    GIS data, population distributions, and crash records. Candidate locations are
    evaluated using both NSGA-III and simulated quantum annealing (SQA) implemented
    on dedicated hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
    Results reveal explicit trade-offs among cost, accessibility, equity, and safety,
    while highlighting underserved and high-risk areas. The comparative analysis
    demonstrates that SQA achieves performance comparable to NSGA-III and shows
    promise for scaling complex infrastructure siting problems in urban planning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pedestrian routing plays a critical role in urban mobility, accessibility,
      and safety analysis. Conventional routing approaches often prioritize shortest
      paths or minimum travel time, which may fail to capture pedestrian-specific
      considerations such as perceived safety, walkability, and accessibility.
      This research aims to develop a routing framework that better reflects
      pedestrian decision-making in urban environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Research Objectives</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>To represent pedestrian networks using GIS-based spatial graph models.</li>
      <li>To incorporate multiple routing criteria beyond distance and time.</li>
      <li>To analyze trade-offs among competing routing objectives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>

    <p>
      The pedestrian routing problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization
      problem on a spatial network. Each network segment is associated with multiple
      attributes, such as geometric distance, safety indicators, and accessibility
      measures. Optimization techniques are applied to identify efficient routes
      under different preference scenarios.
    </p>

    <h2>Research Contributions</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>A GIS-based framework for multi-criteria pedestrian routing analysis.</li>
      <li>Integration of spatial data and optimization models for decision support.</li>
      <li>Systematic evaluation of routing outcomes under varying objective weights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ongoing and Future Directions</h2>

    <p>
      Ongoing work explores extensions to dynamic routing under congestion and
      uncertainty, as well as the application of advanced optimization approaches,
      including heuristic and quantum-inspired methods, to large-scale pedestrian
      networks.
